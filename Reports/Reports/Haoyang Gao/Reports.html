                            <p>We will use Git as our version control system. And we will use Github to maintain the service.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Offline Working - </strong>We are not full-time coder, so we should work under various
                                    situation. The connection of network should not affect the workflow. With Git, we can
                                    work without internet, make a commit, browser complete history, merge or create branches.</li>
                                <li><strong>Tolerance for errors - </strong>Since Git is a distributed version control system.
                                    It maintains the full version history in your own disk, every member of the team might
                                    have full history of the whole project. So, it is very hard to break a repository.</li>
                                <li><strong>Workflow - </strong>Working with branch is very easy with git. Combining its distributed
                                    essential, you can design a workflow which exactly fits your team best.</li>

                            <p>We will divide the whole project development into 6 phases. Design, learn, architecture, developement,
                                test and publish. Every phase get its own deadline. And it is ordered which means it should
                                be finished one by one.</p>
                            <p>The first final deadline is 23th May as the assignment 2 ends. The following table doesn't provide
                                any plan after that date because after the project is ALPHA, that means we at least have
                                a functional project, so we need a new plan to push the product to the BETA phase.</p>

                            <p>Since each phases have different purpose. It is hard to estimate them from the same perspetive.
                                So we will use time as a universal standard to do the estimation part. The duration of phases
                                indicates the importantness of each phases. </p>
                            <p>The learning phase plays an important role in assignment 1 since we don't need to provide the
                                completed work at the final deadline, we should focus on learning which will benefits in
                                the long run.</p>
                            <p><strong>TIPS:</strong>The start date is 14 April as the assignment 1 ends and the calculation
                                includes the end date.</p>

                            <p>In Design, learn, architecture, test and publish phase, everyone will get envolved, and the deadline
                                is listed above. Things get a little tricky when the develop phase start, since the whole
                                project is about two part: platform and app. The whole team will be divided into 2 subteams,
                                one subteam is responsible for the platform, the other is responsible for the smart watch.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Problem:</strong>
                                <br>This is like the traditional web programming, front-end group(smart watch) and back-end group(platform).
                                Here we will face the first problem, the develoment of platform and smart watch will both
                                get the UI part and logic part. But the smart watch team will reply on the platform because
                                the smart watch sits on top of the platform, it needs the platform to deliver some API which
                                it can then use to play with. </p>
                            <p><strong>Solution:</strong>
                                <br>The platform subteam will first develop some fake API for the test case while the smart watch
                                subteam work on the UI. This means when as soon as the smart watch subteam finish the UI
                                phase, it will immediately receive all the API it needs to implement the functionalities
                                even the return data is faked, they can test the UI with data! And the platform subteam now
                                have sufficient time to implement the real business logic and UI part of platform.</p>
