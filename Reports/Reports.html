                        <h3>2.1 Smart Watch Application Description</h3>
                        <p>Our smart watch application is a restaurant locator using the google maps API that has the following
                            functionalities:
                        </p>
                        <h4>Phase 1: before eating</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Find</b> - The restaurant using a drop down menu for the type of food you want (eg. French,
                                Korean) and by using a drop down filter for the results such as distance/ratings. Note: we
                                came to the conclusion that drop downs are the best method for this smart watch application
                                as there is limited room for an onscreen keyboard and voice commands aren't reliable.</li>
                            <li><b>History</b> - Shows the history of previously searched restaurants so that you can quickly
                                find the searched restaurant if you haven't found anything better than it.</li>
                            <li><b>Favorites</b> - Can selectively add restaurants to a list for quick lookup later.</li>
                            <li><b>Recommendations</b> - A separate function from search accessed through the main menu of the
                                app that gives you ideas of restaurants that have a good rating if you don't have a particular
                                type of food that you want.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Individually selected restaurants will be shown fully on the screen and the user should be able to
                            swipe to the next restaurant. The user should also have the restaurant's contact details shown
                            if available</p>

                        <h4>Phase 2: On the way</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Navigation</b> - The search results will have numbered pins on google maps for the restaurant
                                matching the search parameters. The app will have a top down or 45 degree view of google
                                maps which has the yellow line marker showing the path towards the chosen restaurant.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Phase 3: After Eating</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Like</b> - 5 star system that rates the restaurant you ate at.</li>
                            <li><b>Share</b> - Recommend to others using facebook or twitter.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>2.2 Relationship between emulator and prototype</h3>
                        <p>The emulator will handle all the draw calls such as the framing of google maps/app GUI within the
                            confines of the smartwatch visual representation in the browser. It should handle all the API
                            requests that the application needs when prompted by the user through the app GUI. The emulator
                            should be functional in any web browser.</p>
                        <p>The prototype should rely on the emulator for allowed functionalities of the smartwatch. The prototype
                            is just the GUI(buttons/layout) that the user interacts with to get the location of a restaurant.
                        </p>

                        <h3>2.3 Related products</h3>
                        <p>Restaurant related apps seem to be a lot less prominent in the smartwatch/android wear market than
                            in the android smartphone/browser market. While there are hundreds of apps for smartphones that
                            locate restaurants, there are only a handful of apps that are compatible with smart watches.
                            <ul>
                                <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eat24.app">Eat24</a> - Is a prominent
                                    and consistently recommended app for smart watches and has the following features: </li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Filters - Sort by distance/newest/toprated/delivery & pickup/health</li>
                                    <li>Pay options - Stored credit card info or PayPal/Android Play</li>
                                    <li>Food specific searches - Search particulars such as burgers/pizza etc</li>
                                    <li>Favourites</li>
                                    <li>Ability to order from a restaurant directly from the app - This feature is fairly unique
                                        to this app though it requires participation/cooperation from the restaurants</li>
                                </ul>
                                <li>Embedded in apps such as <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.nz/">TripAdvisor</a></li>
                                <li>Franchise specific apps such as PizzaHut</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p> All restaurant related apps seem to have the basic similarities such as:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>A method to input the search the type of food they are looking for</li>
                                <li>Filtering system - Filter based on rating/distance</li>
                                <li>A rating system - Usually 5 star system
                            </ul>

                            <p> Areas they differ in can be </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Restaurant specific prices for each item on the menu</li>
                                <li>Ability to order at specific restaurants from the app</li>
                                <li>Output format of the search. Some apps list the restaurants in a scrollable list. Others
                                    use pins on a map.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>We will use Git as our version control system. And we will use Github to maintain the service.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Offline Working - </strong>We are not full-time coder, so we should work under various
                                    situation. The connection of network should not affect the workflow. With Git, we can
                                    work without internet, make a commit, browser complete history, merge or create branches.</li>
                                <li><strong>Tolerance for errors - </strong>Since Git is a distributed version control system.
                                    It maintains the full version history in your own disk, every member of the team might
                                    have full history of the whole project. So, it is very hard to break a repository.</li>
                                <li><strong>Workflow - </strong>Working with branch is very easy with git. Combining its distributed
                                    essential, you can design a workflow which exactly fits your team best.</li>

                            <p>We will divide the whole project development into 6 phases. Design, learn, architecture, developement,
                                test and publish. Every phase get its own deadline. And it is ordered which means it should
                                be finished one by one.</p>
                            <p>The first final deadline is 23th May as the assignment 2 ends. The following table doesn't provide
                                any plan after that date because after the project is ALPHA, that means we at least have
                                a functional project, so we need a new plan to push the product to the BETA phase.</p>

                            <p>Since each phases have different purpose. It is hard to estimate them from the same perspetive.
                                So we will use time as a universal standard to do the estimation part. The duration of phases
                                indicates the importantness of each phases. </p>
                            <p>The learning phase plays an important role in assignment 1 since we don't need to provide the
                                completed work at the final deadline, we should focus on learning which will benefits in
                                the long run.</p>
                            <p><strong>TIPS:</strong>The start date is 14 April as the assignment 1 ends and the calculation
                                includes the end date.</p>

                            <h3>7.3 Some Details</h3>
                            <p>In Design, learn, architecture, test and publish phase, everyone will get envolved, and the deadline
                                is listed above. Things get a little tricky when the develop phase start, since the whole
                                project is about two part: platform and app. The whole team will be divided into 2 subteams,
                                one subteam is responsible for the platform, the other is responsible for the smart watch.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Problem:</strong>
                                <br>This is like the traditional web programming, front-end group(smart watch) and back-end group(platform).
                                Here we will face the first problem, the develoment of platform and smart watch will both
                                get the UI part and logic part. But the smart watch team will reply on the platform because
                                the smart watch sits on top of the platform, it needs the platform to deliver some API which
                                it can then use to play with. </p>
                            <p><strong>Solution:</strong>
                                <br>The platform subteam will first develop some fake API for the test case while the smart watch
                                subteam work on the UI. This means when as soon as the smart watch subteam finish the UI
                                phase, it will immediately receive all the API it needs to implement the functionalities
                                even the return data is faked, they can test the UI with data! And the platform subteam now
                                have sufficient time to implement the real business logic and UI part of platform.</p>
