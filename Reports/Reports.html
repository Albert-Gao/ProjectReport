                        <h3>2.1 Smart Watch Application Description</h3>
                        <p>Our smart watch application is a restaurant locator using the google maps API that has the following
                            functionalities:
                        </p>
                        <h4>Phase 1: before eating</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Find</b> - The restaurant using a drop-down menu for the type of food you want (eg. French,
                                Korean) and by using a drop down filter for the results such as distance/ratings. Note: we
                                came to the conclusion that drop downs are the best method for this smart watch application
                                as there is limited room for an on-screen keyboard and voice commands aren't reliable.</li>
                            <li><b>History</b> - Shows the history of previously searched restaurants so that you can quickly
                                find the searched restaurant if you haven't found anything better than it.</li>
                            <li><b>Favorites</b> - Can selectively add restaurants to a list for quick lookup later.</li>
                            <li><b>Recommendations</b> - A separate function from search accessed through the main menu of the
                                app that gives you ideas of restaurants that have a good rating if you don't have a particular
                                type of food that you want.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Individually selected restaurants will be shown fully on the screen and the user should be able to
                            swipe to the next restaurant. The user should also have the restaurant's contact details shown
                            if available</p>

                        <h4>Phase 2: On the way</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Navigation</b> - The search results will have numbered pins on google maps for the restaurant
                                matching the search parameters. The app will have a top down or 45-degree view of google
                                maps which has the yellow line marker showing the path towards the chosen restaurant.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Phase 3: After Eating</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Like</b> - 5-star system that rates the restaurant you ate at.</li>
                            <li><b>Share</b> - Recommend to others using facebook or twitter.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>2.2 Relationship between emulator and prototype</h3>
                        <p>The emulator will handle all the draw calls such as the framing of google maps/app GUI within the
                            confines of the smartwatch visual representation in the browser. It should handle all the API
                            requests that the application needs when prompted by the user through the app GUI. The emulator
                            should be functional in any web browser.</p>
                        <p>The prototype should rely on the emulator for allowed functionalities of the smartwatch. The prototype
                            is just the GUI(buttons/layout) that the user interacts with to get the location of a restaurant.
                        </p>

                        <h3>2.3 Related products</h3>
                        <p>Restaurant related apps seem to be a lot less prominent in the smartwatch/android wear market than
                            in the android smartphone/browser market. While there are hundreds of apps for smartphones that
                            locate restaurants, there are only a handful of apps that are compatible with smart watches.
                            <ul>
                                <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eat24.app">Eat24</a> - Is a prominent
                                    and consistently recommended app for smart watches and has the following features: </li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Filters - Sort by distance/newest/top rated/delivery & pickup/health</li>
                                    <li>Pay options - Stored credit card info or PayPal/Android Play</li>
                                    <li>Food-specific searches - Search particulars such as burgers/pizza etc</li>
                                    <li>Favourites</li>
                                    <li>Ability to order from a restaurant directly from the app - This feature is fairly unique
                                        to this app though it requires participation/cooperation from the restaurants</li>
                                </ul>
                                <li>Embedded in apps such as <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.nz/">TripAdvisor</a></li>
                                <li>Franchise specific apps such as PizzaHut</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p> All restaurant related apps seem to have the basic similarities such as:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>A method to input the search the type of food they are looking for</li>
                                <li>Filtering system - Filter based on rating/distance</li>
                                <li>A rating system - Usually 5-star system
                            </ul>

                            <p> Areas they differ in can be </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Restaurant specific prices for each item on the menu</li>
                                <li>Ability to order at specific restaurants from the app</li>
                                <li>The output format of the search. Some apps list the restaurants in a scrollable list. Others
                                    use pins on a map.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h1><a name="vs">3 Version Control</a></h1>
                            <p>We will use Git as our version control system. And we will use Github to maintain the service.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Offline Working - </strong>We are not a full-time coder, so we should work under
                                    the various situation. The connection of network should not affect the workflow. With
                                    Git, we can work without the internet, make a commit, browser complete history, merge
                                    or create branches.</li>
                                <li><strong>Tolerance for errors - </strong>Since Git is a distributed version control system.
                                    It maintains the full version history in your own disk, every member of the team might
                                    have a full history of the whole project. So, it is very hard to break a repository.</li>
                                <li><strong>Workflow - </strong>Working with the branch is very easy with git. Combining its
                                    distributed essential, you can design a workflow which exactly fits your team best.</li>

                            <h4>Chosen Language: TypeScript</h4>
                            <p>Reasons:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Strongly Typed - Which means fewer bugs and less debugging time.</li>
                                <li>Implements lots of ECMA6 functionalities.</li>
                                <li>Open Source - Biggest maintainer is Microsoft, but it is open source. Googles famous AngularJS
                                    uses TypeScript as the official language in its V2 edition.</li>
                                <li>Super set of ECMA(standard of JavaScript). Shares the same syntax system with JavaScript.</li>
                                <li>Well supported by nearly every IDE, especially Intellisense.</li>
                                <li>Class-based Object Orientated so it's familiar to java in that sense</li>
                                <li>Module support</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Possible cons are mostly implicit:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Type annotations - Which may be cumbersome</li>
                                <li>Not all third-party libraries have ambient definitions - Have to maintain own definitions
                                    if we want to use a particular library</li>
                                <li>A compile step is required to transform TypeScript into JavaScript</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h1><a name="ide">5 IDE</a></h1>

                            <h3>Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)</h3>

                            <h4>License</h4>
                            <p>Licensing is taken into consideration when picking an IDE. If this was a real world project the
                                budgeting and the availability/support of the IDE may factor into what one is needed. Most
                                of the open-source IDEs allow for integration of developed plugins adding features that are
                                appealing for what is needed, whereas licensed IDEs such as Webstorm have integrated a lot
                                of features already so there may not be a need for plugins.</p>

                            <h4>Operating System</h4>
                            <p>Most IDEs can be used on Windows, Linux and OS-X (Mac) which are the known desktop OS by most
                                people, although there are others. Other OS such as Android for a selection of smartphones
                                also has support by certain IDEs. But for this project the main point is selecting an IDE
                                that runs on Windows, Linux and OS-X as development will mainly be focused on these OS (with
                                future endeavours of porting to a smart device)</p>

                            <h4>Features</h4>
                            <p>As stated before most of the open-source IDEs have plugins available to incorporate as needed.
                                Taking this into consideration if there is a feature you want then there is most likely a
                                plugin for it (if not then there is an opening for a plugin to be developed). With Webstorm
                                it is a licensed program so must be purchased BUT has many features integrated so there may
                                not be a need to get plugins. This could be put into the time scheme of things, although
                                plugins can easily be searched for most IDEs it may take the time to integrate the features
                                you need for the project. Whereas if the features are already present then this saves time
                                integrating and can focus on learning how to use the program (if there was no previous experience).</p>

                            <h4>Open-source IDE</h4>
                            <p> As the open-source IDEs can have plugins and relatively the same features it is good to get
                                a few reviews from those that have used it themselves. Searching for comparisons of IDEs
                                results in many articles and reviews of a variety of IDEs. Many of them break it down to
                                bullet points, naming features, usability and the general look of the user interface of each
                                IDE. One such article by <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/sitepoint-smackdown-atom-vs-brackets-vs-light-table-vs-sublime-text/">Craig Buckler</a>                                compared the IDEs; Atom, Brackets, Light Table and Sublime Text. To quote the article he
                                suggested to follow this criterion:</p>
                            <ol>

                            <p> Alongside individual reviews there are <a href="http://www.slant.co/topics/1686/compare/~webstorm_vs_sublime-text_vs_atom"> dedicated websites</a>                                which provide comparisons to help with selecting the correct IDE.</p>

                            <h4>Webstorm</h4>

                            <p>As Webstorm is a licensed program and is available through Otago University resources it can
                                be up for consideration, but if this were a real world project it may be a factor of "do
                                we really need the Webstorm features?" as commercial use requires a license (if there is
                                an intention to publish this application). Due to this Webstorm may not be needed for this
                                project and an open-source IDE could surface with selecting features that are required to
                                complete the project.</p>

                            <h4>What is the best choice?</h4>

                            <p><strong>Brackets</strong> would be a good IDE to use, due to it being open-source (developers
                                create pluggins for it) and is maintained very well, available on all platforms (Windows,
                                Mac, Linux) the learning curve (taking into account those within the group that have not
                                had much experience with development) and the ability to incorporate features that are needed
                                to help complete the project. But due to lack of TypeScript support (version is 2 years out
                                of date) the next best option is <strong>Sublime Text</strong>, as it was highly rated in
                                reviews and has many of the features that are needed for the project, much like Brackets
                                (alongside plugins).</p>


                            <h1><a name="debug">6 Debugging Tools</a></h1>
                            <p>We will predominantly use Chrome's developer tools for debugging our javascript, as this tool
                                set has very much become the industry standard. This means that there is a lot of (up to
                                date) material online explaining how to use it, including a google sponsored Code School
                                <a href="http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/">course</a>.</p>
                            <p>Firefox debugging tool Firebug will of course be used if we encounter issues that appear in Firefox
                                but not in chrome, to try and discover what is causing the differing behavior. Between these
                                two most bugs should be found. Firebug is actually in the <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/10/firebug-devtools-integration/">process</a>                                of unifying itself with native Firefox developer tools. The <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/">Firefox developer
edition</a> incorporates this, as well as a number of other tools, and is actually something that we might look into if have
                                the time and inclination further down the line.</p>
                            <p>Both Chrome's developer tools and firebug support source maps, an important feature as we'll
                                be using TypeScript, so would like to debug using our source rather than the compiled javascript
                                that the developer tools would otherwise see.</p>
                            <p>In the end it doesn't really matter too much which one we use (Microsoft also have developer
                                tools in their Edge browser, but it is not widely used by developers nor by the general public,
                                so lacks supporting material), as both serve the same purpose, and go about it in only slightly
                                different ways. We can set breakpoints in both, step through the code line by line, query
                                values at different points in the code and so on.</p>

                            <p>We will divide the whole project development into 6 phases. Design, learn, architecture, development,
                                test and publish. Every phase gets its own deadline. And it is ordered which means it should
                                be finished one by one.</p>
                            <p>The first final deadline is 23th May as the assignment 2 ends. The following table doesn't provide
                                any plan after that date because after the project is ALPHA, that means we at least have
                                a functional project, so we need a new plan to push the product to the BETA phase.</p>

                            <p>Since each phase have a different purpose. It is hard to estimate them from the same perspective.
                                So we will use time as a universal standard to do the estimation part. The duration of phases
                                indicates the importantness of each phase. </p>
                            <p>The learning phase plays an important role in assignment 1 since we don't need to provide the
                                completed work at the final deadline, we should focus on learning which will benefit in

                            <p>In Design, learn, architecture, test and publish phase, everyone will get involved, and the deadline
                                is listed above. Things get a little tricky when the develop phase start since the whole
                                project is about two part: platform and app. The whole team will be divided into 2 subteams,
                                one subteam is responsible for the platform, the other is responsible for the smart watch.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Problem:</strong>
                                <br>This is like the traditional web programming, front-end group(smart watch) and back-end group(platform).
                                Here we will face the first problem, the development of the platform and smart watch will both
                                get the UI part and logic part. But the smart watch team will reply on the platform because
                                the smart watch sits on top of the platform, it needs the platform to deliver some API which
                                it can then use to play with. </p>
                            <p><strong>Solution:</strong>
                                <br>The platform subteam will first develop some fake API for the test case while the smart watch
                                subteam work on the UI. This means when as soon as the smart watch subteam finish the UI
                                phase, it will immediately receive all the API it needs to implement the functionalities
                                even the return data is faked, they can test the UI with data! And the platform subteam now
                                has sufficient time to implement the real business logic and UI part of the platform.</p>
