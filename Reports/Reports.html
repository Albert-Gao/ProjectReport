                        <h3>2.1 Smart Watch Application Description</h3>
                        <p>Our smart watch application is a restaurant locator, making use the google maps API. We envisage that
                          it will have the following features:
                        </p>
                        <h4>Phase 1: before eating</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Find</b> - Will filter nearby restaurants using a drop-down menu to select the type of food the user wants
                              (eg. French, Korean) with the ability to sort the results by distance or ratings, accessible through another
                              drop-down menu. Note: we came to the conclusion that drop-downs are the best method for this smart watch application
                                as there is limited room for an on-screen keyboard and voice commands aren't yet reliable (or indeed always
                                socially acceptable!).</li>
                            <li><b>History</b> - Shows the history of restaurants from previous searches so that you can quickly
                                find them again if you don't found anything better in subsequent searches.</li>
                            <li><b>Favourites</b> - Can selectively add restaurants to a list to quickly look them up again later.</li>
                            <li><b>Recommendations</b> - A separate function from search, accessed through the main menu of the
                                app that gives you ideas of restaurants that have a good rating. Useful if you don't have a particular
                                type of food that you want.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Selecting a restaurant will bring it up in fullscreen view, with the user able to
                            swipe to the next restaurant. The user should also have the restaurant's contact details shown
                            if available.</p>

                        <h4>Phase 2: On the way</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Navigation</b> - The search results will have numbered pins on google maps for the restaurant
                                matching the search parameters. The app will have a top down or 45-degree view of google
                                maps which has the yellow line marker showing the path towards the chosen restaurant.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Phase 3: After Eating</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Like</b> - 5-star system that rates the restaurant you ate at.</li>
                            <li><b>Share</b> - Recommend to others using facebook or twitter.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>2.2 Relationship between emulator and prototype</h3>
                        <p>The emulator will handle all the draw calls, such as the framing of google maps/app GUI within the
                            confines of the visual representation of the smart watch in the browser. It should handle all the API
                            requests that the application needs when prompted by the user through the app GUI. The emulator
                            should be functional in any web browser.</p>
                        <p>The prototype should rely on the emulator for allowed functionalities of the smartwatch. The prototype
                            is just the GUI(buttons/layout) that the user interacts with to get the location of a restaurant.
                        </p>

                        <h3>2.3 Related products</h3>
                        <p>Restaurant related apps seem to be a lot less prominent in the smart watch market than
                            in the smart phone market. While there are hundreds of apps for smart phones that
                            locate restaurants, there are only a handful of apps that are compatible with smart watches.
                            <ul>
                                <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eat24.app">Eat24</a> - Is a prominent
                                    and consistently recommended app for smart watches and has the following features: </li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Filters - Sort by distance/newest/top rated/delivery & pickup/health.</li>
                                    <li>Pay options - Stored credit card info or PayPal/Android Pay.</li>
                                    <li>Food-specific searches - Search particulars such as burgers/pizza etc.</li>
                                    <li>Favourites.</li>
                                    <li>Ability to order from a restaurant directly from the app - This feature is fairly unique
                                        to this app, requiring participation/cooperation from the restaurants.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <li>Embedded in apps such as <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.nz/">TripAdvisor</a>.</li>
                                <li>Franchise specific apps such as PizzaHut.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p> All restaurant related apps seem to have the basic similarities such as:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>A method to input the search the type of food they are looking for.</li>
                                <li>Filtering system - Filter based on rating/distance.</li>
                                <li>A rating system - Usually a 5-star system.
                            </ul>

                            <p> Areas they differ in can be:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Prices for items on the menu of restaurants.</li>
                                <li>Ability to order at specific restaurants from the app.</li>
                                <li>The output format of the search. Some apps list the restaurants in a scrollable list. Others
                                    use pins on a map.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <hr>
                            <h1><a name="vs">3 Version Control</a></h1>
                            <p>We will use Git as our version control system. And we will use Github to maintain the service.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Working offline - </strong>We are not full-time developers with dedicated offices, so we
                                  need to be able to work in various different situations. Having a network connection should not affect
                                  the workflow. With Git, we can work without the internet, make a commit, browse complete history, merge
                                    or create branches, and only push these changes to github once we do get back online.</li>
                                <li><strong>Tolerance for errors - </strong>This comes from Git being a distributed version control system.
                                    It maintains the full version history on your own disk, with every member of the team able to
                                    have a full history of the whole project. It is therefore very hard to break a repository.</li>
                                <li><strong>Workflow - </strong>Working with branches is very easy with Git. Combined with its
                                    distributed nature, it is possible to design efficient workflows to fit the team's needs.</li>

                            <h4>Chosen Language: TypeScript</h4>
                            <p>Reasons:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Strongly Typed - fewer bugs and less debugging time.</li>
                                <li>Implements lots of ECMA6 functionalities.</li>
                                <li>Open Source - Biggest maintainer is Microsoft, but it is open source. Google's famous AngularJS
                                    uses TypeScript as the official language in its V2 edition.</li>
                                <li>Superset of ECMA(standard of JavaScript). Shares the same syntax system with JavaScript.</li>
                                <li>Well supported by nearly every IDE, especially Intellisense.</li>
                                <li>Class-based, object-orientated design so similar to java in that sense.</li>
                                <li>Support for modules.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Possible cons are mostly implicit:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Type annotations - may be cumbersome.</li>
                                <li>Not all third-party libraries have ambient definitions - may have to maintain our own definitions
                                    if we want to use a particular library.</li>
                                <li>A compile step is required to transform TypeScript into JavaScript</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)</h3>

                            <h4>License</h4>
                            <p>Licensing is taken into consideration when picking an IDE. If this were a real world project the
                                budgeting and the availability/support of the IDE may factor into which one is needed. Most
                                of the open-source IDEs allow for integration of plugins, adding additional features that are
                                appealing for certain use cases, whereas licensed IDEs such as Webstorm have integrated a lot
                                of features already so there may not be a need for plugins.</p>

                            <h4>Operating System</h4>
                            <p>Most IDEs can be used on Windows, Linux and OSX (Mac) which are big 3 desktop operating systems, and known by most
                                people, although others do exist. Even mobile operation systems such as Android and iOS have IDEs available,
                                though it's doubtful they're used for much serious development. For this project however the main point
                                is to select an IDE can run on Windows, Linux and OSX, as development will be focused on these platforms (with
                                future endeavours of porting to a smart device)</p>

                            <h4>Features</h4>
                            <p>As stated above, most of the open-source IDEs have plugins available that can be incorporated as needed.
                                Taking this into consideration, if there is a feature you want then there is most likely a
                                plugin for it (and if not then there is an opening for a plugin to be developed). With Webstorm
                                it is a licensed program so must be purchased BUT it does have many integrated features so there may
                                not be a need for many plugins. In terms of time this could be an advantage, as although
                                plugins can easily be searched for, it may take time to integrate and learn how to use the features it brings that
                                are needed for a project. On the other hand, if the features needed are already present, time is saved, and focus can
                                instead be on learning how to better use the program.</p>

                            <h4>Open-source IDE</h4>
                            <p> As the open-source IDEs can have many different plugins and offer many of the same features, it is good to get
                                a few reviews from those that have used them. Searching for comparisons of IDEs
                                results in many articles and reviews for a variety of IDEs. Many of them break it down into
                                bullet points, naming features, usability and the general look of the user interface of each
                                IDE. One such article by <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/sitepoint-smackdown-atom-vs-brackets-vs-light-table-vs-sublime-text/">Craig Buckler</a>                                compared the IDEs; Atom, Brackets, Light Table and Sublime Text. To quote the article he
                                suggested trying to find something that meets the following criteria:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Suited to web development</li>
                                <li>Cross-platform and work on Windows, Mac and Linux. Your preferences and settings should be
                                    available regardless of which OS you’re using.</li>
                                <li>General-purpose text editors which support typical web languages. You should be able to use
                                    the same application for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, SQL, markdown and more.</li>
                                <li>Highly customizable with cross-platform plugins and themes.</li>
                                <li>Fast and stable. Launching should never be a once-a-day dread like some IDEs.</li>
                                <li>Immediately usable without a steep learning curve or having to remember numerous keyboard
                                    shortcuts.
                                </li>
                            </ol>


                            <p>In using this criteria, Craig explained the strengths and weaknesses of each IDE and squared them
                                off against each other, giving each category a winner.
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>The Interface: Brackets</li>
                                <li>Syntax Support: Sublime Text</li>
                                <li>Ease of Use and Learning Curve: Brackets</li>
                                <li>Speed and Stability: Sublime Text</li>
                                <li>Native Feature Set: Sublime Text</li>
                                <li>Web Specific Features: Brackets</li>
                                <li>Plugins and Extensions: Sublime Text</li>
                                <li>Customization and Hackability: Atom</li>
                                <li>The Future: Atom</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>
                                Although Sublime Text toke most of the categories, Brackets was a close runner up in a selection of this categories.
                            </p>
                            <p> Alongside individual reviews there are <a href="http://www.slant.co/topics/1686/compare/~webstorm_vs_sublime-text_vs_atom"> dedicated websites</a>                                which provide comparisons to help with selecting the correct IDE.</p>

                            <h4>Webstorm</h4>

                            <p>As Webstorm is a licensed program and is available through Otago University resources it can
                                be up for consideration, but if this were a real world project it may be a factor of "do
                                we really need the Webstorm features?" as commercial use requires a license (if there is
                                an intention to publish this application). Due to this Webstorm may not be needed for this
                                project and an open-source IDE could surface with selecting features that are required to
                                complete the project.</p>

                            <h4>What is the best choice?</h4>

                            <p><strong>Brackets</strong> would be a good IDE to use, due to it being open-source (developers
                                create pluggins for it) and is maintained very well, available on all platforms (Windows,
                                Mac, Linux) the learning curve (taking into account those within the group that have not
                                had much experience with development) and the ability to incorporate features that are needed
                                to help complete the project. Unfortunately, due to the lack of TypeScript support (the supported version is 2 years out
                                of date) the next best option is <strong>Sublime Text</strong>, as it was highly rated in
                                reviews, has many of the features that needed for the project, and has a very strong and well supported developer community.

                            <p>We will predominantly use Chrome's developer tools for debugging our javascript, as this tool
                                set has very much become the industry standard. This means that there is a lot of (up to
                                date) material online explaining how to use it, including a google sponsored Code School
                                <a href="http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/">course</a>.</p>
                            <p>Firefox debugging tool Firebug will of course be used if we encounter issues that appear in Firefox
                                but not in chrome, to try and discover what is causing the differing behavior. Between these
                                two most bugs should be found. Firebug is actually in the <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/10/firebug-devtools-integration/">process</a>                                of unifying itself with native Firefox developer tools. The <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/">Firefox developer
edition</a> incorporates this, as well as a number of other tools, and is actually something that we might look into if have
                                the time and inclination further down the line.</p>
                            <p>Both Chrome's developer tools and firebug support source maps, an important feature as we'll
                                be using TypeScript, so would like to debug using our source rather than the compiled javascript
                                that the developer tools would otherwise see.</p>
                            <p>In the end it doesn't really matter too much which one we use (Microsoft also have developer
                                tools in their Edge browser, but it is not widely used by developers nor by the general public,
                                so lacks supporting material), as both serve the same purpose, and go about it in only slightly
                                different ways. We can set breakpoints in both, step through the code line by line, query
                                values at different points in the code and so on.</p>

                            <p>We will divide the whole project development into 6 phases. Design, learn, architecture, development,
                                test and publish. Every phase gets its own deadline. And it is ordered which means it should
                                be finished one by one.</p>
                            <p>The first major deadline is 23th May, when assignment 2 is due. The following table doesn't provide
                                any plan after that date because after the project is in ALPHA, meaning we, at the very least, have
                                a functional project, so would need a new plan to push the product to the BETA phase.</p>

                            <p>Since each phase has different objectives it is hard to accurately estimate how long each will take.
                            Below is a rough plan that we hope to stick to with the duration of each phase indicating its relative importance. </p>
                            <p>The learning phase plays an important role in this assignment, especially seeing as we don't need to provide fully
                                completed work by the next deadline. We should therefore focus on learning which will be of most benefit in
                                the long run.</p>
                            <p><strong>TIPS: </strong>The start date is 14 April as assignment 1 ends then. The durations
                                include the ending dates.</p>

                            <p>In Design, learn, architecture, test and publish phases, everyone will get involved, the deadline for which are
                                listed above. Things get a little tricky when the development phase starts since the whole
                                project is split into two parts: platform and app. The team will be divided into 2 subteams,
                                one subteam is responsible for the platform, the other is responsible for the smart watch.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Problem:</strong>
                                <br>This is like traditional web programming; front-end group(smart watch) and back-end group(platform).
                                Here we will face the first problem; the development of the platform and smart watch will both
                                get the UI part and logic part. But the smart watch team will rely on the platform because
                                the smart watch sits on top of it, so will need the platform to deliver some API which
                                it can then use to play with. </p>
                            <p><strong>Solution:</strong>
                                <br>The platform subteam will first develop some fake API for the test case while the smart watch
                                subteam work on the UI. This means that as soon as the smart watch subteam finishes the UI
                                phase, it will immediately receive all the API it needs to implement the functionalities
                                even if the return data is faked, the UI can be tested! The platform subteam will then
                                has sufficient time to implement the real business logic and UI part of the platform.</p>
