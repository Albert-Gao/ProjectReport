<h2 id="debugging">Debugging</h2>
<p>We will predominantly use Chrome's developer tools for debugging our javascript,
as this tool set has very much become the industry standard. This means that there
is a lot of (up to date) material online explaining how to use it, includinga google
sponsored Code School <a href="http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/">course</a>.</p>
<p>Firefox debugging tool Firebug will of course be used if we encounter issues that
appear in Firefox but not in chrome, to try and discover what is causing the differing
behaviour. Between these two most bugs should be found. Firebug is actually in
the <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/10/firebug-devtools-integration/">process</a> of
unifying itself with native Firefox developer tools. The <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/">Firefox developer
edition</a> incorporates this, as well
as a number of other tools, and is actually something that we might look into if have
the time and inclination further down the line.</p>
<p>Both Chrome's developer tools and firebug support source maps, an important feature
as we'll be using TypeScript, so would like to debug using our source rather than the
transpiled javascript that the developer tools would otherwise see.</p>
<p>In the end it doesn't really matter too much which one we use (Microsoft also have
developer tools in their Edge browser, but it is not widely used by developers
nor by the general public, so lacks supporting material), as both serve the same
purpose, and go about it in only slightly different ways. We can set breakpoints in
both, step through the code line by line, query values at different points in the
code and so on.</p>
