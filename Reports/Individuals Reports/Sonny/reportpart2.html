		<h3>Smart Watch Application Description</h3>
			<p>Our smart watch application is a restaurant locator using the google maps API that has the following functionalities:</p>
					<h4>Phase 1: before eating</h4>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Find</b> - The restaurant using a drop down menu for the type of food you want (eg. French, Korean) and by using a drop down filter for the results such as distance/ratings. Note: we came to the conclusion that drop downs are the best method for this smart watch application as there is limited room for an onscreen keyboard and voice commands aren't reliable.</li>
						<li><b>History</b> - Shows the history of previously searched restaurants so that you can quickly find the searched restaurant if you haven't found anything better than it.</li>
						<li><b>Favorites</b> - Can selectively add restaurants to a list for quick lookup later.</li>
						<li><b>Recommendations</b> - A separate function from search accessed through the main menu of the app that gives you ideas of restaurants that have a good rating if you don't have a particular type of food that you want.</li>
					</ul>
						
						<p>Individually selected restaurants will be shown fully on the screen and the user should be able to swipe to the next restaurant. The user should also have the restaurant's contact details shown if available</p>
					
					<h4>Phase 2: On the way</h4>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Navigation</b> - The search results will have numbered pins on google maps for the restaurant matching the search parameters. The app will have a top down or 45 degree view of google maps which has the yellow line marker showing the path towards the chosen restaurant.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h4>Phase 3: After Eating</h4>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Like</b> - 5 star system that rates the restaurant you ate at.</li>
						<li><b>Share</b> - Recommend to others using facebook or twitter.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h3>Relationship between emulator and prototype</h3>
					<p>The emulator will handle all the draw calls such as the framing of google maps/app GUI within the confines of the smartwatch visual representation in the browser. It should handle all the API requests that the application needs when prompted by the user through the app GUI. The emulator should be functional in any web browser.</p>
					<p>The prototype should rely on the emulator for allowed functionalities of the smartwatch. The prototype is just the GUI(buttons/layout) that the user interacts with to get the location of a restaurant. </p>
					
					<h3>Related products</h3>
					<p>Restaurant related apps seem to be a lot less prominent in the smartwatch/android wear market than in the android smartphone/browser market. While there are hundreds of apps for smartphones that locate restaurants, there are only a handful of apps that are compatible with smart watches. 
						<ul>
							<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eat24.app">Eat24</a> - Is a prominent and consistently recommended app for smart watches and has the following features: </li>
								<ul>
									<li>Filters - Sort by distance/newest/toprated/delivery & pickup/health</li>
									<li>Pay options - Stored credit card info or PayPal/Android Play</li>
									<li>Food specific searches - Search particulars such as burgers/pizza etc</li>
									<li>Favourites</li>
									<li>Ability to order from a restaurant directly from the app - This feature is fairly unique to this app though it requires participation/cooperation from the restaurants</li>
								</ul>
							<li>Embedded in apps such as <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.nz/">TripAdvisor</a></li>
							<li>Franchise specific apps such as PizzaHut</li>
						</ul>
					
					<p> All restaurant related apps seem to have the basic similarities such as:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>A method to input the search the type of food they are looking for</li>
							<li>Filtering system - Filter based on rating/distance</li>
							<li>A rating system - Usually 5 star system
						</ul>
						
					<p> Areas they differ in can be </p>
						<ul>
							<li>Restaurant specific prices for each item on the menu</li>
							<li>Ability to order at specific restaurants from the app</li>
							<li>Output format of the search. Some apps list the restaurants in a scrollable list. Others use pins on a map.</li>
						</ul>
