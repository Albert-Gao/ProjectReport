		<h3>Programming language</h3>
		<h4>Chosen Language: TypeScript</h4>
		<p>Reasons:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Strongly Typed - Which means less bugs and less debugging time.</li>
			<li>Implements lots of ECMA6 functionalities.</li>
			<li>Open Source - Biggest maintainer is Microsoft, but it is open source. Googles famous AngularJS uses TypeScript as the official language in its V2 edition.</li>
			<li>Super set of ECMA(standard of JavaScript). Shares the same syntax system with JavaScript.</li>
			<li>Well supported by nearly every IDE, especially Intellisense.</li>
			<li>Class-based Object Orientated so it's familiar to java in that sense</li>
			<li>Module support</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Possible cons are mostly implicit:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Type annotations - Which may be cumbersome</li>
			<li>Not all third-party libraries have ambient definitions - Have to maintain own definitions if we want to use a particular library</li>
			<li>A compile step is required to transform TypeScript into JavaScript</li>
		</ul>
