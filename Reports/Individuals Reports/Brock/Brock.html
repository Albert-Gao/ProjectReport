    <h3>Intergrated Development Environments (IDEs)</h3>

 <!--   <p> When we pick light-weight IDE such as Sublime, ATOM, Brackets, VS Code </p>
    <ul>
        <li>We prefer their faster speed</li>
        <li>Clean environment, so we can extend them with the add-ins that we like</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When we pick heavy IDE like Webstorm</p>

    <ul>
        <li>They are saving tons of time, because they have integrated lots of features, so we don't need to look somewhere else.</li>
        <li>Most of them, have better support when you work as a team.</li>
        <li>They have some killer features like live editing in Webstorm which is really superb.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>State which editor you will use and why. You should look briefly at Eclipse, NetBeans, BlueFish, Brackets, and WebStorm. All of these except WebStorm are open source, and we have a licence for WebStorm. You should search on the web for comparisons of these programs; while we forbid plagiarism, research is good. The difference is honesty about who did what, giving credit where credit is due. You should include a short list of features that matter to you and why they matter.</p> -->

    <h3>License</h3>
    <p>Licensing is taken into consideration when picking an IDE. If this was a real world project the budgetting and the availability/support of the IDE may factor into what one is needed. Most of the open-source IDEs allow for intergration of developed pluggins adding features that are appealing for what is needed, whereas licensed IDEs such as Webstorm have intergrated alot of features already so there may not be a need for pluggins.</p>

    <h3>Operating System</h3>
    <p>Most IDEs can be used on Windows, Linux and OS-X (Mac) which are the known desktop OS by most people, although there are others. Other OS such as Android for a selection of smartphones also have support by certain IDEs. But for this project the main point is selecting an IDE that runs on Windows, Linux and OS-X as development will mainly be focused on these OS (with future endevours of porting to a smart device)</p>

    <h3>Features</h3>
    <p>As stated before most of the open-source IDEs have pluggins available to incorporate as needed. Taking this into consideration if there is a feature you want then there is most likely a pluggin for it (if not then there is an opening for a pluggin to be developed). With Webstorm it is a licensed program so must be purchased BUT has many features intergrated so there may not be a need to get pluggins. This could be put into the time scheme of things, although pluggins can easliy be searched for most IDEs it may take time to intergrate the features you need for the project. Whereas if the features are already present then this saves time intergrating and can focus on learning how to use the program (if there was no previous experience).</p>

    <h3>Open-source IDE</h3>
    <p> As the open-source IDEs can have pluggins and relatively the same features it is good to get a few reviews from those that have used it themselves. Searching for comparisons of IDEs results in many articles and reviews of a variaty of IDEs. Many of them break it down to bulletpoints, naming features, usability and the general look of the user interface of each IDE. One such article by <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/sitepoint-smackdown-atom-vs-brackets-vs-light-table-vs-sublime-text/">Craig Buckler</a> compared the IDEs; Atom, Brackets, Light Table and Sublime Text. To quote the article he suggested to follow this criteria:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Suited to web development</li>
        <li>Cross-platform and work on Windows, Mac and Linux. Your preferences and settings should be available regardless of which OS youâ€™re using.</li>
        <li>General-purpose text editors which support typical web languages. You should be able to use the same application for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, SQL, markdown and more.</li>
        <li>Highly customizable with cross-platform plugins and themes.</li>
        <li>Fast and stable. Launching should never be a once-a-day dread like some IDEs.</li>
        <li>Immediately usable without a steep learning curve or having to remember numerous keyboard shortcuts.</li>
    </ol>


    <p>In using this criteria Craig explained the strengths and weaknesses of each IDE and squared them off against each other, giving each catogory a winner.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>The Interface: Brackets</li>
        <li>Syntax Support: Sublime Text</li>
        <li>Ease of Use and Learning Curve: Brackets</li>
        <li>Speed and Stability: Sublime Text</li>
        <li>Native Feature Set: Sublime Text</li>
        <li>Web Specific Features: Brackets</li>
        <li>PLugins and Extensions: Sublime Text</li>
        <li>Customization and Hackability: Atom</li>
        <li>The Future: Atom</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Although Sublime Text toke most of the categories, Brackets was a close runner up in a selection of this catergories.
    </p>
    <p> Along side individual reviews there are <a href="http://www.slant.co/topics/1686/compare/~webstorm_vs_sublime-text_vs_atom"> dedicated websites</a> which provide comparisons to help with selecting the correct IDE.</p>

    <h3>Webstorm</h3>

    <p>As Webstorm is a licensed program and is available through Otago University resources it can be up for consideration, but if this were a real world project it may be a factor of "do we really need the Webstorm features?" as commercial use requires a license (if there is an intention to publish this application). Due to this Webstorm may not be needed for this project and an open-source IDE could surfice with selecting features that are required to complete the project.</p>

    <h3>What is the best choice?</h3>

    <p><strong>Brackets</strong> would be a good IDE to use, due to it being open-source (developers create pluggins for it) and is maintained very well, available on all platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux) the learning curve (taking into account those within the group that have not had much experience with development) and the ability to incorporate features that are needed to help complete the project. But due to lack of TypeScript support (version is 2 years out of date) the next best option is <strong>Sublime Text</strong>, as it was highly rated in reviews and has many of the features that are needed for the project, much like Brackets (along side pluggins).</p>
