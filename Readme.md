1. Just update your report to the directory named *Reports*
2. ALWAYS CREATE YOUR OWN BRANCH TO START WITH!
  1. Make sure that you are at MASTER branch
  2. Create your own branch, e.g. AlbertDevs
  3. Switch to your branch using `git checkout <new branch name>`
  4. Code and test on your own branch
  5. Merge into master branch when you finish
3. Always PULL before PUSH
4. We'll use the following popular workflow model, but at this time, just feel free to merge your final work from your own branch to MASTER branch, since we are working on different files, this shouldn't be a problem.
